# Variation in Turkish stems 
## Final voiced stops 


Turkish stems(words/morphemes that can stand alone) ending with the consontants **d, b, and c** undergo what is known as "devoicing" or "terminal devoicing". Which means that the ending consontants change to their voiceless counterpart under the following conditions: 

1) When the word stands alone without a *suffix*, or 
2) when a *suffix* beginning with a consonant is added, the voiced consonants become: 
	**d** => **t** 
	**b** => **p**
	**c** => **ç**
For example: 
kasap (butcher) => /kasab/ (as a stand alone word with no suffix)
	kasaplar (butchers) => b becomes p before l

but when a suffix beginning with a vowel is added, the voiced stop remains the same: 
	kasap => kasabım 

Genç (young) => /genc/ (as a stand alone word with no suffix)
	the final /c/ becomes unvoiced 
	Genç => Gençler 
	Genç + im => Gencim (the final /c/ is retained)

Changing the case of a noun( with the –I suffix): 

Kitap(Nom) => Kitabı(obj) 
top(Nom) => topu (obj) (there is no change)
Mehmet(Nom) => Mehmedı (obj)
ağaç(Nom) => ağacı(obj)
armut(Nom) => armudu(obj)


# Final g 

The turkish g may not appear at the end of the word or before another consonant. Similiarly it follows the same rules/pattern since it is also a voiced stop: 

1) At the end of a word after a consonant or after a vowel, **g** becomes **k**

For example: 
renk(color) => /reng/ 
	renk + ler => renkler 
	renk + -i => rengi
çocuk(child) => /çocug/

When g appears between two vowels, it changes to ğ. For example: 
çocuk + -um => çocuğum 
büyük + -üm => büyüğüm 

If a word is more than one syllable that is found with the *final k* almost ends basically with the /g/ 

### Word about prounication 
Sometimes these words are actually pronounced with a final voiced stop. For example in ad (name), öd (bile), uc (end), and ab (water). However, some individual speakers may pronounce them with the corresponding voiceless stop in all cases.
