### Infintive form


Infinitive – the **to + verb** of a verb – is the form normally used to *referring* to the verb, and it is the verb form usually found in the dictionary. In turkish, by attaching the suffix -mEk (/-mEg/) to the verb stem. 


görmek => (gör + mek) => "to see"
yazmak => (yaz + mak) => "to write"


### Definite past tense 

The definite past tense is formed by adding the suffix **-DI** to the verb stem, and the personal endings are added after it. This tense is used when:

1) the action that happened in the past, 
2) the speaks knows from his personal observation that the action took place 

The personal endings differ used with this suffix slightly: 

['I' –m; 'we' –k]
['you (sg)' -n; 'you(pl)' -nIz]
['he, she, it' nothing; 'they' nothing or -IEr]

Note: **-IEr** is omitted whenever it is not necessary. When there is no indication of the plurality of the subject, it is used. 

For example: Geldiler (They have come) and Adamlar geldi (the men have come)


### The objective case 

Definite nouns in the objective case are marked by the objective suffix -(y)i and this suffix is not used with indefinite noun.

Halil kitap okudu (halil read a book)
Halil kitabı okudu (halil read the book)

Köpekler gördüm (I saw some dogs)
Köpeklerı gördüm (I saw the dogs)

if the object is a proper noun or a pronoun, the -(y)I is required.
